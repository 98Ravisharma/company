We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.<br><br>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.<br><br>Winnow’s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% over 2 - 12 months, and maintained at these levels, with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers, and a net saving of staff time due to reduced food preparation and waste handling. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for restaurants. Watch our short videos on our YouTube channel to see the system in action.<br><br>We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do. We are excited about like minded talent who share these values, joining us in our mission:<br><br>Equal parts head and heart. We’re both passionate and measured. We carefully balance the need for quick solutions and pragmatism with the ability to step back, take in the bigger picture and build for the long term.<br><br>Bravely honest. With each other, that means we’re a transparent organisation where healthy, respectful debate is encouraged. With our customers, we challenge them if we don’t think they’re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.<br><br>People of action. Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We’re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.<br><br>Bound by food. We’re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.<br><br>Hungry and humble. Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we’re hungry for change. But, we’re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.<br><br>People and Planet Positive. We’re caretakers of the planet, helping to preserve and support it for now and the future.

TypeDB is built with open-source distributed technology stacks: RocksDB, ANTLR, SCIP, Bazel, and GRPC. Today, TypeDB is written in Java, but we are in the process of rewriting it in Rust, with clients implemented in multiple languages, such as Java, Python, and Node.js. The extensive build system of TypeDB is built with Kotlin and Bazel.<br><br>TypeDB Cluster: the distributed version of TypeDB, using the same open-source distributed technologies (plus ZeroMQ), built through a reactive architecture implementing the Raft replication algorithms. TypeDB Cluster serves as our commercial offering that provides TypeDB users with scalability, security, configurability and management tools to effectively use TypeDB in a production environment. Today, TypeDB Cluster is written in Java, but we're now rewriting it in Rust. The extensive build system is also built with Kotlin and Bazel.<br><br>TypeDB Studio: the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of TypeDB. Studio allows developers to manage their TypeDB project source code (e.g. schema and data), interactively manage the database schema, data and users, as well as query the database to produce graph visualisations of their data. Studio is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.<br><br>Vaticle Factory: the in-house built CI platform that automates our entire software development life cycle from testing, benchmarking, tracing, quality checking, dependency upgrading, verifying (releases), and releasing. Vaticle Factory is designed for engineering teams building distributed systems on multi-repo architectures that require performance benchmarking. Vaticle Factory is built in the cloud, using the Kubernetes technology stack. Today, Vaticle Factory is written in Java and React, but we're now rewriting it in Rust, Angular, and TypeScript.<br><br>Vaticle Cloud: the cloud platform in which TypeDB will be automatically deployed, managed, and orchestrated in any of the popular cloud services: GCP, AWS, or Azure. Similar to Vaticle Factory, Vaticle Cloud is built in the cloud, using the Kubernetes technology stack. Vaticle Cloud is also built in Rust, Angular, and TypeScript.<br><br>Across all technologies, your primary languages for development will be Rust, Kotlin, and TypeScript.<br><br>As a Software Engineer, you will be assigned to one technology at a time from the list above, rotating to various other projects over time, to acquire the skills and experience to grow as a Software Engineer, and impact various technologies in the company. Each assignment will be decided based your interest, skillset, experience, and the team development needs at the time. Your work will span across all aspects of software engineering; from programming and debugging, to architecture design, build engineering, release engineering, documentation, workflow automation, code reviews, as well as R&D.<br></p><br><br><p><strong>Technologies:</strong></p><p>- Angular<br>- Cucumber<br>- Docker<br>- Figma<br>- IntelliJ<br>- Java<br>- Kotlin<br>- Kubernetes<br>- RabbitMQ<br>- Rust<br>- React<br>- TypeScript<br>- gRPC<br>- Bazel<br>- TypeDB<br>- TypeQL</p><br><p>More: </p>Vaticle is a team of people driven to empower engineers to solve complex problems. We are the creators of the strongly-typed database, TypeDB, and its query language, TypeQL. Our technology helps organisations in various industries, including Life Sciences, Defence & Security, Financial Services and Robotics, to build intelligent systems that tackle complex problems. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery, our technology empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of complexity in data and knowledge.<br><br>We've built a pioneering developer community of 9,000+ engineers, spread over 20 countries, and counting. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.<br><br>You will be joining a team that cares deeply not just about the intelligence of the technology, but also the elegance and simplicity of the solution. We have a strong sense of urgency, but we always care about 'why' something needs to be developed, and we make sure that we work purposefully. Although we are expected to be independent in delivering our responsibilities, we collaborate in perfecting our ideas and solutions. Every time we have an opportunity to improve our workflow, infrastructure or architecture to achieve better performance, user experience or developer productivity, we take that opportunity, and we grow.

Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. <br><br>In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. <br><br>With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. <br><br>Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. <br><br>The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).<br> ",
